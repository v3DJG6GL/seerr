## Getting Started

For instructions on how to install and run **Jellyseerr**, please refer to the official documentation:

https://docs.seerr.dev/getting-started/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Seerr is not officially released yet.**  
> The project is currently available **only on the `develop` branch** and is intended for **beta testing only**.

The documentation linked above is for running the **latest Jellyseerr** release.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are migrating from **Overseerr** to **Seerr** for beta testing, **do not follow the Jellyseerr latest setup guide**.

Instead, follow the dedicated migration guide (with `:develop` tag):
https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr/blob/develop/docs/migration-guide.mdx

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT run Jellyseerr (latest) using an existing Overseerr database. This includes third-party images with `seerr:latest` (as it points to jellyseerr 2.7.3 and not seerr.**  
> Doing so **may cause database corruption and/or irreversible data loss and/or weird unintended behaviour**. 

For migration assistance, beta testing questions, or troubleshooting, please join our **Discord** and ask for support there.
